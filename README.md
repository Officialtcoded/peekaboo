# Married Valentine — Omolara (LaPearl)

## How to use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click it), or serve the folder with any local server.
2. Add your real photos here (create the folder if it doesn’t exist):
   - `assets/photos/photo-1.jpg`
   - `assets/photos/photo-2.jpg`
   - `assets/photos/photo-3.jpg`
   - `assets/photos/photo-4.jpg`
   - `assets/photos/photo-5.jpg`

If you don’t add photos, the gallery will automatically show romantic placeholders.

## Background music (optional)

This project includes a bundled romantic instrumental MP3:

- `assets/music/romantic.mp3`

The site includes a **Play our song** button (autoplay is intentionally not used, so it works reliably on mobile browsers).
